## Developer Note

As wonderful as Sketch is, it has some issues exporting SVGs. In the root directory is a file called `fix-svg.py` that does exactly as it says. If you run `python fix-svg.py`, it will iterate through the Branding directory and remove a UI bug where the glpyh's red arc would be closed. After exporting all new files from Sketch into this repository, run this script to fix this UI bug.
